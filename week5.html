  <h1>Week 5 – Security Hardening (Fail2Ban)</h1>

  <h2>Objective</h2>
  <p>
    The objective of this phase was to implement intrusion prevention mechanisms
    to protect the server from brute-force attacks, particularly targeting SSH.
  </p>

  <h2>Fail2Ban Configuration</h2>
  <p>
    Fail2Ban was installed and configured to monitor SSH authentication logs.
    When repeated failed login attempts were detected, the offending IP address
    was automatically blocked.
  </p>

  <h2>Verification</h2>
  <p>
    The screenshot above confirms that Fail2Ban is active and has successfully
    banned an IP address after multiple failed login attempts. This significantly
    reduces the risk of brute-force attacks on the server.
  </p>

  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>
    Implementing Fail2Ban enhances system security by actively responding to
    suspicious activity and enforcing automated protection mechanisms.
