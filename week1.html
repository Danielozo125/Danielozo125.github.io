  <h1>Week 1 – System Planning</h1>

  <h2>Objectives</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Plan system architecture</li>
    <li>Install and configure a virtual machine</li>
    <li>Prepare the environment for future security testing</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>System Architecture</h2>
  <p>
    A VirtualBox-based environment was planned to host the operating system used for this coursework.
    This provides a controlled and repeatable platform for configuring security controls and running
    performance tests in later weeks.
  </p>

  <h2>Evidence</h2>

  <h3>Virtual Machine Configuration</h3>
  <p>
    The screenshot below shows the virtual machine configuration, including memory allocation and system settings.

  <h3>Operating System Installation</h3>
  <p>
    The screenshot below confirms the successful installation of the operating system.

  <h2>Reflection</h2>
  <p>
    This week established the foundation of the project by creating a stable virtual environment and confirming
    the operating system installation. This setup supports the required SSH-based administration and prepares
    the system for security hardening and performance monitoring in future phases.
