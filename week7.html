  <h1>Week 7 – Security Audit and Hardening</h1>

  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>
    In this phase, a full system security audit was conducted using <strong>Lynis</strong>.
    The tool evaluates system configuration, security controls, and hardening levels
    to identify potential vulnerabilities.
  </p>

  <h2>Lynis Audit Results</h2>
  <p>
    The scan analyzed system services, file permissions, authentication mechanisms,
    and security policies. The results provided a hardening index and highlighted
    areas for improvement.

  <h2>Reflection</h2>
  <p>
    Conducting a full system audit confirmed that previous security configurations,
    including firewall rules and SSH hardening, were correctly applied. The audit
    provided actionable insights to further strengthen the system against threats.
